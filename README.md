# Brain Tumor Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Project Overview
This (ONGOING) project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain tumors from medical imaging data. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient model for identifying different tumor types, which can have significant applications in healthcare diagnostics.

## Motivation
Driven by a passion for applying machine learning to healthcare, this project aims to explore the potential of AI to improve patient care and diagnostic processes. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to:
- Gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow and Keras, libraries previously unfamiliar.
- Deepen understanding of CNN architectures.
- Tackle a real-world problem with the potential to impact healthcare.

## Goals and Objectives
Key goals of this project include:
- Building a CNN model for classifying brain tumors.
- Learning and applying TensorFlow and Keras to design and train the model.
- Evaluating and optimizing the model's performance for higher accuracy.
- Exploring real-world challenges and applications of machine learning in healthcare.
